# FHPC - a.y. 2022/2023
This repository contains solutions to the exercises for the exam in Foundations of High Performance Computing at University of Trieste.

Brief description of the exercises
1. Implementation of a hybrid MPI - OpenMP code for Conway's Game of Life.
    For this exercise I implemented the code and ran some scalability tests. Implementation choices and results are discussed in detail in the report.
2. Benchmark of BLAS funtions.
    For this exercise I ran benchmarks for different linear algebra libraries, on different machines. I tried to get the best possible performance out of the machine and presented my results in the report.
